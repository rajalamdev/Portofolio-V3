          Hey there, I'm Raj Alam, but you can call me Alam. I've got around 4
          years of experience in Web Development. My coding journey began way
          back in my first year of high school. and My first programming
          language was Java, how did that happen? Well, here's the funny story:
          I was curious about Web Development and how websites are created.
          After reading some articles, I found out that JavaScript was one of
          the languages used for web stuff. And guess what? I thought Java was
          shorthand for JavaScript LOL. As a result, I began searching for Java
          programming tutorials on YouTube.
        </p>
        <p>
          After studying Java for a few months, I finally realized that Java and
          JavaScript are actually different programming languages LOL! Once I
          understood this distinction, I immediately switched to JavaScript and
          started learning a lot about Web Development, continuing up until now.
